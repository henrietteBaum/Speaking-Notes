## Speek

The speek-function uses the [Web Speech Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).
The Web Speech API enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: 
- SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech) and 
- SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition)

The Speechsynthesis uses the voices, that the System supports.
Every `SpeechSynthesisVoice` has its own relative speech service including information about language, name and URI.

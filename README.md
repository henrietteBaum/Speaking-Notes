# Speeking Notes

The project is for learning purposes only. It shows how "Text to Speech" functions can be implemented. The aim is also to make the user interface accessible, especially for people with visual impairments.

Currently, only German voices are used for reading aloud.

## Speek

The speek-function uses the [Web Speech Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).
The Web Speech API enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: 
- SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech) and 
- SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition)

The Speechsynthesis uses the voices, that the System supports.
Every `SpeechSynthesisVoice` has its own relative speech service including information about language, name and URI.
